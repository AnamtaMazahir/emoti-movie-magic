## ü§ñ Development Process & Acknowledgements

This project was initiated using the AI coding assistant, **loveable.dev**, to rapidly bootstrap the initial structure and components. My role was to:

1.  Define the project requirements and core features.
2.  Guide the AI with specific prompts to build the desired UI and logic.
3.  Customize the generated code, particularly the styling and component layout, to match my vision.
4.  Debug and refine the application to ensure full functionality.

Using this tool was a great learning experience in leveraging AI for modern web development, allowing me to focus on high-level architecture and user experience.
